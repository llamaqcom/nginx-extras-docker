Unofficial dockerized build of nginx-extras - based on debian:stable-slim with run-as user:group support.

Source: https://github.com/llamaqcom/nginx-extras-docker

Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/llamaq/nginx-extras

## Usage

Here is a basic snippet to help you get started creating a container.

```
docker run -dit --restart unless-stopped \
    --name nginx-extras \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    -v </path/to/nginx/config/dir>:/opt/config \
    -e PUID=1000 \
    -e PGID=1000 \
    llamaq/nginx-extras
```

In case of `</path/to/nginx/config/dir>` is empty on host, it will be pre-populated with original nginx configuration.
